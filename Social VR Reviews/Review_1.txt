Not the Metaverse I want to see..
Embarrassing for Meta, technically it’s Recroom and VRChat combined in the worse way possible, like it’s really forcing you to not think that way whatsoever. Recently Meta has been forcing people to sign up for a Horizon Account when they enter the Oculus app, not letting them get through without doing so. The only positives I have is that I somewhat enjoy the simple building style like the menu screen, but it does get boring onwards. I also do like the games a bit, but of course they are boring as-well because the building that Meta gave this game is also very simplistic. Most of the players are children under the age of 13, while I met some people in their twenties as well. The moderators 90% don’t do anything about the underage kids, when literally oculus is designed for 13 and older and so is the GAME. T moderators pretty much greet you and have a simple conversation, which isn’t bad, but not doing your job is a bad thing. Overall just get Recroom or VRChat, maybe even play this to see how it is, I don’t know. I’ve always told myself I would try this again but I never did.
